## Dataset
> a distributed collection of items called a Dataset,which has better performance than RDD. Datasets can be created from Hadoop InputFormats (such as HDFS files) or by transforming other Datasets.

## DataFrame

> A DataFrame is a Dataset organized into named columns. It is conceptually equivalent to a table in a relational database or a data frame in R/Python, but with richer optimizations under the hood. 

> Throughout this document, we will often refer to Scala/Java Datasets of Rows as DataFrames.   `DataFrame=DataSet[Row]`
